# Title: Gambling culture and M&A decision——Evidence from China

**Main content:** This paper investigates whether gambling culture influences M&A decision-making in China. We find that firms in regions with stronger gambling cultures tend to initiate M&As. This result is robust to a battery of robustness checks. Furthermore, we reveal that firms’ risk-taking level and executives’ overconfidence are two mechanisms. The paper also implies that CEOs without academic backgrounds, a lower proportion of female executives, and a poorer legal system may exacerbate this effect. Finally, the economic consequence of this relationship is worse long-term M&A performance. This paper integrates the informal institution gambling culture into the research framework of micro-enterprise M&A behaviors.

**Key Words:** Gambling culture; M&A; Risk-taking; Overconfidence
