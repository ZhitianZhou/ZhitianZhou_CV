# Title: 'Honorable Reputation' or 'Over-acclaimed': Reputation of Financial Advisor and the Achievement of Performance Commitment

**Abstract:** While studies exploring the impact of financial advisors on M&A behavior and performance are gradually emerging, the empirical evidence on the reputation-quality mechanism remains inconclusive. This paper examines the impact of financial advisors' reputations on M&A performance commitments and finds that higher-reputation advisors lead to a higher accomplishment ratio, even after the supervision period ends， highlighting their role in effective oversight. Furthermore, there is a lower probability of performance deterioration for M&A projects involving high-reputation financial advisors after the end of the commitment period. Mechanism analysis reveals that financial advisor reputation filters risks by ensuring commitment realization through a lower growth rate, increased likelihood of setting up equity and double-side compensation, and less likely to alter the commitment. Additionally, the relation⁃ ship between higher-reputation financial advisors and achieving the commitments is more significant in firms with stronger tunneling incentives and during periods of economic downturns. In summary, this paper provides direct evidence for the effectiveness of financial advisors' reputations as determinants in performance commitments while delivering policy insights into their role in serving the real economy and maintaining financial stability.
