# Title: 'Honorable Reputation' or 'Over-acclaimed': Reputation of Financial Advisor and the Achievement of Performance Commitment

**Abstract:** This paper examines the impact of financial advisors' reputation on the achievement of performance commitment. We find that higher-reputation financial advisors in M&A generally lead to higher accomplishment ratio of commitments and a lower probability of performance change after the commitment period. And the reputation mechanism of financial advisors gradually emerges in the second and third years of the commitment period. The mechanism analysis shows that the reputation of financial advisor filters the risks to ensure the realization of the performance commitment by a lower growth rate, more likely to set up equity and double-side compensation, and less likely to change the commitment. Furthermore, the relationship between the reputation of financial advisors and the achievement of performance commitments is more significant in firms with stronger tunneling incentives and the period with slower macroeconomic growth rate. In summary, this research points out that the reputation of financial advisors is an important factor affecting achievement of performance commitment, which not only provides direct evidence for the effectiveness of financial advisorsâ€™ reputation mechanism, but also provides empirical evidence for regulators to strengthen the intermediary function of financial advisors and promote the industry institutions to achieve a stable and far-reaching development on the road of high-quality development.
