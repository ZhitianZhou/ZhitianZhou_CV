# Title: Stock Exchange Comment Letters and Performance Commitment: Risk Warning or Effective Supervision? 

**Abstract:** To investigate the regulatory impact of the stock exchange's inquiries concerning M&A performance commitments. Drawing upon data spanning the years 2013 to 2022, with a focus on aligning performance commitments with the stock exchange's inquiries, this study discerns that while the stock exchange has not yet effectively supervised performance commitments, its review of past performance commitment incidents can still act as a risk alert for future commitments. Investors demonstrate a noteworthy ability to discern this signal, which becomes evident through short-term market reactions observed on the initial announcement date of M&A events. Furthermore, the introduction of directors' and officers' liability insurance, the engagement of higher-reputation financial advisors, and the ongoing fortification of regulatory policies synergistically combine with the stock exchange's comment letters to realize effective oversight of performance commitments. This research not only contributes to the extension of the body of knowledge concerning external governance mechanisms for performance commitments but also furnishes empirical evidence supporting the enhancement of the supervisory efficacy of the comment letter system in relation to performance commitments.

**Key words:** Comment Letters; Performance Commitment; Risk Warning; Effective Supervision
